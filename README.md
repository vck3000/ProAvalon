# ProAvalon
Online platform for The Resistance!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Pre-requisites


What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Node.js v7.6 or later
- MongoDB
- Git

### Installing

1. Clone (using git) a copy of the code:
```
cd C:/YourFolder
git clone https://github.com/vck3000/ProAvalon.git
```
2. Set up the required environment variables on your machine:
```
MY_PLATFORM = "local"
MY_SECRET_KEY = "AnythingThatYouWant"
DATABASEURL = "mongodb://localhost/TheNewResistanceUsers"
```
3. Create the database in MongoDB:
```
Start the database:
> mongod
Open a mongo shell (in a new terminal or command prompt):
> mongo
Create the database:
> use TheNewResistanceUsers
switched to db TheNewResistanceUsers
```
4. Install Node modules
```
> npm install
```

## Running
```
node app.js
```
Or with nodemon (automatically restarts the server when changes are saved):
```
nodemon app.js
```

## Overview
This is a Node.js express application that is currently deployed on Heroku. There are three stages: Production (live server), Development/staging (master branch of this repo) and other Heroku servers for each pull request.

When a pull request is made, a Heroku server is generated with those changes. Testing can be done on that online server. I will find a way to provide the link when you make the pull request if possible.

After a pull request has been merged to master, it will be on the development server. When approved, I will promote it to the production server.

User authentication is handled by Passport.js and client-server communication is handled by Socket.io. They are combined by [passport.socketio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport.socketio)


The server is run from app.js. 

Routes are all under the routes folder. index.js is the upper most layer (most broad).

After users log in, they are redirected to the lobby page where the sockets.js file handles socket communication (under the sockets folder).

All scripts and stylesheets are under the assets folder. The lobby.ejs file is perhaps the most complicated. I have broken the file down into smaller pieces and required them at the bottom of lobby.ejs.

There is a server-wide cache of 30 minutes for all files. This helps cut down on data usage, while also solving the issue of certain iPhone devices "flashing" every game iteration (the browser would re-download each image every time before caching was introduced).

There is also a middleware folder which contains useful functions mainly for authentication purposes on forums and profiles. 

Other Useful global functions can be found under the myFunctions folder. 

## Contributing
If you are new to coding and would like to help contribute, I highly recommend this course on Udemy made by Colt Steel [(Click here)](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). It gave me the starting nudge I needed to make this site. Small contributions are always welcome!

When contributing, please make a new branch and then make pull request. If you require any help, throw me a message through discord or through the server. (Link to the server is included in this Github repository)
