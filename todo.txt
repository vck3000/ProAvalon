To-do list:

- kicking people gives player join notification
- custom mission bar size

- black font whith yellow highlight on dark theme

- sort by ...... options?

- the second tab (if enabled) that is non-chat is a bit too short and should stretch down to the proper height


- /roomChat should only work in a room, /allChat should only work in lobby. perhaps just merge back to the /chat cmd and it'll know which to print when used (but if they'll be automatic, then ignore this).


- Custom colours for specific people



Hak:
List of suggestions
•    Displaying name/number of room in this room
•    Changing properties of game in room such as ranked/unranked or Avalon/resistance
•    Res-only chat
•    Option to remake game, without creating new
•    Custom name rooms
•    /Buzzall option (something like this is good, but private players prolly don’t want be buzzed)
•    Coloring chat (choosing own color or for others)
•    Showing host/all players in room
•    Option to alone upload avatars and rating them, so image may be banned (I don’t like it)
•    Match history

•    Seperating different players chat
•    Readjusting approve/reject button (they aren’t so close and are always at same place)
•    Mvp voting after game (I don’t like it)
•    Levels
•    Assassination clock and picking/voting clock (I like having infinity time for everything, but maybe its good to have some clock)
•    Button to res/spy another player
•    Vote history always visible

•    Better SEO(in progress, Tony wrote it so maybe he knows something about it)
•    Sorting posts on forum
•    Mark as read in forum

also from old suggestion:anonymous mode




***************************************************************************************
DONE: 


Hak:
•    Disable copying certain texts (maybe useful link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8957443/prevent-copying-text-in-web-page/12021733#12021733)
•    Fitting game room better in browser (done) 
•    Logout button (done)



Ref:
+margins for text box (first letter touching side)
+smooth borders for text box?
+a less harsh red for rejects and fails
+reject/approve borders doesnt touch head of avatar
+"1 fails"
+remove "disabled" in buttons
+capitalise lady of the lake
+add spaces to the gameplay text
+numbers centered in boxes on mission size
+When pressing start, you should add "requires 5 players to start" message: I think it would feel more responsive instead of simply doing nothing when you press it
