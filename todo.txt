To-do list:

- kicking people gives player join notification
- custom mission bar size

- black font whith yellow highlight on dark theme

- sort by ...... options?

- hide stats option

- option for space under status bar



- Autocomplete when typing names

- hover over mission in center of table highlights participating members

- the second tab (if enabled) that is non-chat is a bit too short and should stretch down to the proper height

- have alt-text for hovering over lady of the lake


- /roomChat should only work in a room, /allChat should only work in lobby. perhaps just merge back to the /chat cmd and it'll know which to print when used (but if they'll be automatic, then ignore this).

- After clicking the = icon by an avatar, the icon should change colors (ideally to the color that he'll be highlighted to) so i know that it worked

- BUG: Having the char '[' anywhere in the text triggers the quoting feature and truncs any preceding chars. Instead it should be according to the format "[mm:hh] ValidUsername: MsgActuallySaid" and any text added before/after the quote should end up in the lines before/after the quote
- Have Quoted text a color other than grey so its more distinctive from regular chat/spectators. light purple?


- Have an overlay on the Stats Graph for the "Site Average" for each of the bars (average calculated over players who have played at least 50 games). basically a tick for each role showing how i stack up and so i know what is considered "good"

- Custom colours for specific people

- Statistics page

Hak:
List of suggestions
•	Private/public games. Adding passwords
•	Displaying name/number of room in this room
•	Changing properties of game in room such as ranked/unranked or Avalon/resistance
•	Res-only chat
•	Option to remake game, without creating new
•	Custom name rooms
•	/Buzzall option (something like this is good, but private players prolly don’t want be buzzed)
•	Coloring chat (choosing own color or for others)
•	Showing host/all players in room
•	Option to alone upload avatars and rating them, so image may be banned (I don’t like it)
•	Match history

•	Seperating different players chat
•	Readjusting approve/reject button (they aren’t so close and are always at same place)
•	Mvp voting after game (I don’t like it)
•	Levels
•	Assassination clock and picking/voting clock (I like having infinity time for everything, but maybe its good to have some clock)
•	Button to res/spy another player
•	Vote history always visible

•	Better SEO(in progress, Tony wrote it so maybe he knows something about it)
•	Sorting posts on forum
•	Mark as read in forum
•	Display fail/success in vote history

also from old suggestion:anonymous mode




***************************************************************************************
DONE: 


Hak:
•	Disable copying certain texts (maybe useful link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8957443/prevent-copying-text-in-web-page/12021733#12021733)
•	Fitting game room better in browser (done) 
•	Logout button (done)



Ref:
+margins for text box (first letter touching side)
+smooth borders for text box?
+a less harsh red for rejects and fails
+reject/approve borders doesnt touch head of avatar
+"1 fails"
+remove "disabled" in buttons
+capitalise lady of the lake
+add spaces to the gameplay text
+numbers centered in boxes on mission size
+When pressing start, you should add "requires 5 players to start" message: I think it would feel more responsive instead of simply doing nothing when you press it
