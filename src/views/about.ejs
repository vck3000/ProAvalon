    My name is Victor (ProNub), you may call me either :). I am a university
    student studying Engineering, Physics and Computer Science.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is a platform to play The Resistance on. This site was written
    from scratch, however heavily based on cashto's original design to keep a
    similar interface for familiar users.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started making this site with the main goal for me to learn web
    development and enhance my programming skills. It was a good excuse for me
    to learn cool things like HTML, CSS, JS and NodeJs.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are interested in the security of this site and a mini-lecture from
    me to protect yourselves online, take a look <a href="/security">here</a>.

  <p>
    You may contact me by email at
    <a href="mailto:admin@proavalon.com">admin@proavalon.com</a>, or through
    discord. Feel free to throw me a direct message or ping me on the discord
    server. My discord username and tag is
    <span id="discord_name">pkvk9122</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous help of Ref-rain and Hakha3
    who both have tirelessly provided me with feedback from the very start of
    this site, all the way till release and beyond. Without the help of these
    two, this site would not be possible. Thank you guys :).
