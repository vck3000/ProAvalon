<h3>Rules for avatars*:</h3>
<div>
    Avatars:
    <ul>
        <li>Must be easily identifyable as res or spy.</li>
        <li>Must have at least 20% of the original colour (blue or red) and a minimum of the opposite allegiance's colour (approximation).</li>
        <li>Must not be inappropriate.</li>
        <li>Must have similar Res and Spy avatars.</li>
        <li>Must not be similar to any other existing custom avatars (unless the avatar was yours initially).</li>
        <li>Must be <%= VALID_DIMENSIONS_STR %> in size.</li>
        <li>Must be at most <%= MAX_FILESIZE_STR %> in size.</li>
        <li>Must be a png file.</li>
        <li>Must have a transparent background (solid white will hurt the eyes of dark theme users!).</li>
        <li>Must resemble the base avatar images.</li>
        <li>Must keep the wordage to a minimum.</li>
        <li>Moderators have the final say, based on their judgment. Feel free to consult them before making your avatars to ensure they will adhere to these guidelines.</li>
